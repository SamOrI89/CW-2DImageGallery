Create a CSS-only image gallery

- minimum of 6 images, all of the same dimensions (search flickr for instagram?)

- keep images external (don't bloat your GitHub account)

- each image must have a caption that is hidden until user hovers over corresponding image/image container

- must use at least one 2D transform

- must transition at least 2 properties (including at least one 2D transform) when hovering over an image/image container

- layout should be responsive - images should float next to each other and wrap to the next line when the screen shrinks

- must render/function correctly in WebKit (Chrome/Safari) & Firefox

- if you're feeling frisky, throw in some new CSS stuff for fanciness - drop-shadow, rounded corners, gradient, etc

- try to keep things subtle/elegant
